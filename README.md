This is a rudimentary text classifier. It uses a neural network with a single hidden layer, 
and is trained on four essays that are either arguing that Lebron James is a better or worse player.
It then makes a prediction based on another review. The training data is in the form of of one-hot r
of each review relative to an overall vocabulary. 

Essays are courtesy of chatGPT. Validation data will be added in future iterations.
